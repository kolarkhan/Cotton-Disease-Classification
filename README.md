## Introduction
Cotton disease classification is crucial for improving the yield and quality of cotton crops. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to accurately classify different types of cotton diseases from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images of cotton leaves categorized into different disease classes. The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - Cotton Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

## Model Architecture
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Fully connected dense layers

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/kolarkhan/cotton-disease-classification.git
cd cotton-disease-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
